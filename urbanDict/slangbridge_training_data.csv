Ear Cancer,"""In mathematics, [the Pythagorean theorem] or [Pythagoras' theorem] is a relation in Euclidean geometry among the three sides of a right triangle. The theorem is named after the Greek mathematician Pythagoras, who by tradition is credited with its discovery, although knowledge of the theorem almost certainly predates him.
[The Pythagorean theorem]: The sum of the areas of the two squares on the legs (a and b) equals the area of the square on the [hypotenuse] (c).

The theorem is as follows:

        In any right triangle, the area of the square whose side is the hypotenuse (the side of a right triangle opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of areas of the squares whose sides are the two legs (i.e. the two sides other than the hypotenuse).

If we let c be the length of the hypotenuse and a and b be the lengths of the other two sides, the theorem can be expressed as the equation

    a^2 + b^2 = [c^2]. \,

This equation provides a simple relation among the three sides of a right triangle so that if the lengths of any two sides are known, the length of the third side can be found. A generalization of this theorem is the law of cosines, which allows the computation of the length of the third side of any triangle, given the lengths of two sides and the size of the angle between them.

This theorem may have more known proofs than any other. [The Pythagorean] Proposition, a book published in 1940, contains 370 proofs of Pythagoras' theorem, including one by American President James Garfield.

The converse of the theorem is also true:-

        For any three positive numbers a, b, and c such that a² + b² = c², there exists a triangle with sides a, b and c, and every such triangle has a right angle between the sides of lengths a and b.

"""In mathematics, [the Pythagorean theorem] or [Pythagoras' theorem] is a relation in Euclidean geometry among the three sides of a right triangle. The theorem is named after the Greek mathematician Pythagoras, who by tradition is credited with its discovery, although knowledge of the theorem almost certainly predates him.
[The Pythagorean theorem]: The sum of the areas of the two squares on the legs (a and b) equals the area of the square on the [hypotenuse] (c).

The theorem is as follows:

        In any right triangle, the area of the square whose side is the hypotenuse (the side of a right triangle opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of areas of the squares whose sides are the two legs (i.e. the two sides other than the hypotenuse).

If we let c be the length of the hypotenuse and a and b be the lengths of the other two sides, the theorem can be expressed as the equation

    a^2 + b^2 = [c^2]. \,

This equation provides a simple relation among the three sides of a right triangle so that if the lengths of any two sides are known, the length of the third side can be found. A generalization of this theorem is the law of cosines, which allows the computation of the length of the third side of any triangle, given the lengths of two sides and the size of the angle between them.

This theorem may have more known proofs than any other. [The Pythagorean] Proposition, a book published in 1940, contains 370 proofs of Pythagoras' theorem, including one by American President James Garfield.

The converse of the theorem is also true:-

        For any three positive numbers a, b, and c such that a² + b² = c², there exists a triangle with sides a, b and c, and every such triangle has a right angle between the sides of lengths a and b.
